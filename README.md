Hello,

We built an app called boundless for our clients who wanted to give their users a platform to record their travel experiences from city to city. We had three models: cities, users, and posts. We implemented extra features including a google API, the ability to create an admin account to add cities which have full CRUD actions. Users can create an account and also add, create, edit, and delete their posts. 

Users have an option to choose from multiple cities that they've visited, and add a post and see posts that other users have added for that particular city.

We used rails as our framework for this application, postsequal database, and seeded our data through the rails console. 

our app is currently deployed on heroku: https://tranquil-hollows-93014.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up
